</h5>Let $B$ be the reduced row-echelon form of the augmented matrix $\augmented{A}{\vect{b}}$.   Because the system $\linearsystem{A}{\vect{b}}$ is consistent, we know by <a class="knowl" acro="RCLS" type="Theorem" title="Recognizing Consistency of a Linear System" knowl="./knowls/theorem.RCLS.knowl">Theorem RCLS</a> that the last column of $B$ is not a pivot column.  Suppose now that $r&lt;n$.  Then by <a class="knowl" acro="FVCS" type="Theorem" title="Free Variables for Consistent Systems" knowl="./knowls/theorem.FVCS.knowl">Theorem FVCS</a> the system would have infinitely many solutions.  From this contradiction, we see that $r=n$ and the first $n$ columns of $B$ are each pivot columns.  Then the sequence of row operations that converts $\augmented{A}{\vect{b}}$ to $B$ will also convert $A$ to $I_n$.  Applying <a class="knowl" acro="NMRRI" type="Theorem" title="Nonsingular Matrices Row Reduce to the Identity matrix" knowl="./knowls/theorem.NMRRI.knowl">Theorem NMRRI</a> we conclude that $A$ is nonsingular.
