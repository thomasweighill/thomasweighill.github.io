<div class="problem"><p>In <a class="knowl" acro="SCAD" type="Example" title="Span of the columns of Archetype D" knowl="./knowls/example.SCAD.knowl">Example SCAD</a> we began with the four columns of the coefficient matrix of <a knowl="./knowls/archetype.D.knowl">Archetype D</a>, and used these columns in a span construction.  Then we methodically argued that we could remove the last column, then the third column, and create the same set by just doing a span construction with the first two columns.  We claimed we could not go any further, and had removed as many vectors as possible.  Provide a convincing argument for why a third vector cannot be removed.
