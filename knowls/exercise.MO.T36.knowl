<div class="problem"><p>Suppose $A$ is a square matrix.  Prove that there is a symmetric matrix $B$ and a skew-symmetric matrix $C$ such that $A=B+C$.  In other words, any square matrix can be decomposed into a symmetric matrix and a skew-symmetric matrix (<a class="knowl" acro="DC" type="Proof Technique" title="Decompositions" knowl="./knowls/technique.DC.knowl">Proof Technique DC</a>).
