<div class="statement"><p>Suppose $A$ is the augmented matrix of a <em>consistent</em> system of linear equations with $n$ variables.  Suppose also that $B$ is a row-equivalent matrix in reduced row-echelon form with $r$ pivot columns.  Then $r\leq n$.  If $r=n$, then the system has a unique solution, and if $r&lt;n$, then the system has infinitely many solutions.</p></div>
