</h5>The system could be inconsistent.  If it is consistent, then because it has more variables than equations <a class="knowl" acro="CMVEI" type="Theorem" title="Consistent, More Variables than Equations, Infinite solutions" knowl="./knowls/theorem.CMVEI.knowl">Theorem CMVEI</a> implies that there would be infinitely many solutions.  So, of all the possibilities in <a class="knowl" acro="PSSLS" type="Theorem" title="Possible Solution Sets for Linear Systems" knowl="./knowls/theorem.PSSLS.knowl">Theorem PSSLS</a>, only the case of a unique solution can be ruled out.
