</h5>Demonstrate that the system is consistent by verifying any one of the four sample solutions provided.  Then because $n=9&gt;6=m$, <a class="knowl" acro="CMVEI" type="Theorem" title="Consistent, More Variables than Equations, Infinite solutions" knowl="./knowls/theorem.CMVEI.knowl">Theorem CMVEI</a> gives us the conclusion that the system has infinitely many solutions.  Notice that we only know the system will have <em>at least</em> $9-6=3$ free variables, but very well could have more.  We do not know know that $r=6$, only that $r\leq 6$.
