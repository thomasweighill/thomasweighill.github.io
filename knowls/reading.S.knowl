<li>Summarize the three conditions that allow us to quickly test if a set is a subspace.
</li>
<li>Consider the set of vectors
\begin{align*}
W&amp;=\setparts{\colvector{a\\b\\c}}{3a-2b+c=5}
\end{align*}

Is the set $W$ a subspace of $\complex{3}$?  Explain your answer.
</li>
<li>Name five general constructions of sets of column vectors (subsets of $\complex{m}$) that we now know as subspaces.
