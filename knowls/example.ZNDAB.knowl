</h5>
<p>The coefficient matrix in <a knowl="./knowls/archetype.A.knowl">Archetype A</a> has a zero determinant (check this!) while the coefficient matrix <a knowl="./knowls/archetype.B.knowl">Archetype B</a> has a nonzero determinant (check this, too).  These matrices are singular and nonsingular, respectively.  This is exactly what <a class="knowl" acro="SMZD" type="Theorem" title="Singular Matrices have Zero Determinants" knowl="./knowls/theorem.SMZD.knowl">Theorem SMZD</a> says, and continues our list of contrasts between these two archetypes.</p>
