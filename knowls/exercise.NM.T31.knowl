<div class="problem"><p>Suppose that $A$ is a square matrix of size $n\times n$ and that we know there is a <em>single</em> vector $\vect{b}\in\complex{n}$ such that the system $\linearsystem{A}{\vect{b}}$ has a unique solution.  Prove that $A$ is a nonsingular matrix.  (Notice that this is very similar to <a class="knowl" acro="NMUS" type="Theorem" title="Nonsingular Matrices and Unique Solutions" knowl="./knowls/theorem.NMUS.knowl">Theorem NMUS</a>, but is not exactly the same.)
