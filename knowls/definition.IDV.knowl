<p>Suppose $A$ is the augmented matrix of a consistent system of linear equations and $B$ is a row-equivalent matrix in reduced row-echelon form.  Suppose $j$ is the index of a pivot column of $B$.  Then the variable $x_j$ is <em class="term">dependent</em>.  A variable that is not dependent is called <em class="term">independent</em> or <em class="term">free</em>.</p>
