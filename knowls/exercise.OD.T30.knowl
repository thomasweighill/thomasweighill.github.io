<div class="problem"><p>
For the proof of <a class="knowl" acro="PTMT" type="Theorem" title="Product of Triangular Matrices is Triangular" knowl="./knowls/theorem.PTMT.knowl">Theorem PTMT</a> we only show that the product of two lower triangular matrices is again lower triangular.  Provide a proof that the product of two upper triangular matrices is again upper triangular.  Look to the proof of <a class="knowl" acro="PTMT" type="Theorem" title="Product of Triangular Matrices is Triangular" knowl="./knowls/theorem.PTMT.knowl">Theorem PTMT</a> for guidance if you need a hint.
