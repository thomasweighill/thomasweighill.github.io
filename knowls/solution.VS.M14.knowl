</h5>Since addition is unchanged, we only need to check the axioms involving scalar multiplication.  The proposed scalar multiplication clearly fails <a class="knowl" acro="O" type="Property" title="One" knowl="./knowls/property.O.knowl">Property O</a> :  $1A = \zeromatrix_{2,2}\ne A$.  Thus, the proposed set is not a vector space.
