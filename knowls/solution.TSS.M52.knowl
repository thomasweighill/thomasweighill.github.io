</h5>With 6 rows in the augmented matrix, the row-reduced version will have $r\leq 6$.  Since the system is consistent, apply <a class="knowl" acro="CSRN" type="Theorem" title="Consistent Systems, $r$ and $n$" knowl="./knowls/theorem.CSRN.knowl">Theorem CSRN</a> to see that $n-r\geq 2$ implies infinitely many solutions.
