<p>Form the $m\times n$ matrix $A$ whose columns are $\vect{u}_i$, $1\leq i\leq n$.  Consider the homogeneous system $\homosystem{A}$.  By <a class="knowl" acro="HMVEI" type="Theorem" title="Homogeneous, More Variables than Equations, Infinite solutions" knowl="./knowls/theorem.HMVEI.knowl">Theorem HMVEI</a> this system has infinitely many solutions.  Since the system does not have a unique solution, <a class="knowl" acro="LIVHS" type="Theorem" title="Linearly Independent Vectors and Homogeneous Systems" knowl="./knowls/theorem.LIVHS.knowl">Theorem LIVHS</a> says the columns of $A$ form a linearly dependent set, as desired.
