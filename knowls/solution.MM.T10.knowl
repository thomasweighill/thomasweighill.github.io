</h5>Since $\linearsystem{A}{\vect{b}}$ has at least one solution, we can apply <a class="knowl" acro="PSPHS" type="Theorem" title="Particular Solution Plus Homogeneous Solutions" knowl="./knowls/theorem.PSPHS.knowl">Theorem PSPHS</a>.  Because the solution is assumed to be unique, the null space of $A$ must be trivial.  Then <a class="knowl" acro="NMTNS" type="Theorem" title="Nonsingular Matrices have Trivial Null Spaces" knowl="./knowls/theorem.NMTNS.knowl">Theorem NMTNS</a> implies that $A$ is nonsingular.<br><br>
The converse of this statement is a trivial application of <a class="knowl" acro="NMUS" type="Theorem" title="Nonsingular Matrices and Unique Solutions" knowl="./knowls/theorem.NMUS.knowl">Theorem NMUS</a>.  That said, we could extend our NSMxx series of theorems with an added equivalence for nonsingularity, “Given a single vector of constants, $\vect{b}$, the system $\linearsystem{A}{\vect{b}}$ has a unique solution.”
