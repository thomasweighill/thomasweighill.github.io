<li>Suppose $\ltdefn{T}{\complex{5}}{\complex{8}}$ is a linear transformation.  Why is $T$ not surjective?
</li>
<li>What is the relationship between a surjective linear transformation and its range?
</li>
<li>There are many similarities and differences between injective and surjective linear transformations.  Compare and contrast these two different types of linear transformations.  (This means going well beyond just stating their definitions.)
