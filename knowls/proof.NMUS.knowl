<p>(⇐)  The hypothesis for this half of the proof is that the system $\linearsystem{A}{\vect{b}}$ has a unique solution for <em>every</em> choice of the constant vector $\vect{b}$.  We will make a very specific choice for $\vect{b}$:  $\vect{b}=\zerovector$.  Then we know that the system $\linearsystem{A}{\zerovector}$ has a unique solution.  But this is precisely the definition of what it means for $A$ to be nonsingular (<a class="knowl" acro="NM" type="Definition" title="Nonsingular Matrix" knowl="./knowls/definition.NM.knowl">Definition NM</a>).  That almost seems too easy!  Notice that we have not used the full power of our hypothesis, but there is nothing that says we must use a hypothesis to its fullest.</p>

<p>(⇒)  We assume that $A$ is nonsingular of size $n\times n$, so we know there is a sequence of row operations that will convert $A$ into the identity matrix $I_n$ (<a class="knowl" acro="NMRRI" type="Theorem" title="Nonsingular Matrices Row Reduce to the Identity matrix" knowl="./knowls/theorem.NMRRI.knowl">Theorem NMRRI</a>).  Form the augmented matrix $A^\prime=\augmented{A}{\vect{b}}$ and apply this same sequence of row operations to $A^\prime$.  The result will be the matrix $B^\prime=\augmented{I_n}{\vect{c}}$, which is in reduced row-echelon form with $r=n$.  Then the augmented matrix $B^\prime$ represents the (extremely simple) system of equations $x_i=\vectorentry{\vect{c}}{i}$, $1\leq i\leq n$.  The vector $\vect{c}$ is clearly a solution, so the system is consistent (<a class="knowl" acro="CS" type="Definition" title="Consistent System" knowl="./knowls/definition.CS.knowl">Definition CS</a>).  With a consistent system, we use <a class="knowl" acro="FVCS" type="Theorem" title="Free Variables for Consistent Systems" knowl="./knowls/theorem.FVCS.knowl">Theorem FVCS</a> to count free variables.  We find that there are $n-r=n-n=0$ free variables, and so we therefore know that the solution is unique.  (This half of the proof was suggested by Asa Scherer.)</p>
