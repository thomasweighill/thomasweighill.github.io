<div class="problem"><p>Suppose that the set $S$ is linearly independent. Apply the Gram-Schmidt procedure (<a class="knowl" acro="GSP" type="Theorem" title="Gram-Schmidt Procedure" knowl="./knowls/theorem.GSP.knowl">Theorem GSP</a>) twice, creating first the linearly independent set $T_1$ from $S$, and then creating $T_2$ from $T_1$.  As a consequence of <a knowl="./knowls/exercise.O.T30.knowl">Exercise O.T30</a>, prove that $T_1=T_2$.  In other words, it is pointless to apply the Gram-Schmidt procedure twice.
