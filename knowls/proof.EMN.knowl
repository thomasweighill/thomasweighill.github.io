<p>We show that we can row-reduce each elementary matrix to the identity matrix.  Given an elementary matrix of the form $\elemswap{i}{j}$, perform the row operation that swaps row $j$ with row $i$.  Given an elementary matrix of the form $\elemmult{\alpha}{i}$, with $\alpha\neq 0$, perform the row operation that multiplies row $i$ by $1/\alpha$.  Given an elementary matrix of the form $\elemadd{\alpha}{i}{j}$, with $\alpha\neq 0$, perform the row operation that multiplies row $i$ by $-\alpha$ and adds it to row $j$.  In each case, the result of the single row operation is the identity matrix.  So each elementary matrix is row-equivalent to the identity matrix, and by <a class="knowl" acro="NMRRI" type="Theorem" title="Nonsingular Matrices Row Reduce to the Identity matrix" knowl="./knowls/theorem.NMRRI.knowl">Theorem NMRRI</a> is nonsingular.</p>
