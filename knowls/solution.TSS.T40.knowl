</h5>Since the system is consistent, we know there is either a unique solution, or infinitely many solutions (<a class="knowl" acro="PSSLS" type="Theorem" title="Possible Solution Sets for Linear Systems" knowl="./knowls/theorem.PSSLS.knowl">Theorem PSSLS</a>).  If we perform row operations (<a class="knowl" acro="RO" type="Definition" title="Row Operations" knowl="./knowls/definition.RO.knowl">Definition RO</a>) on the augmented matrix of the system, the two equal columns of the coefficient matrix will suffer the same fate, and remain equal in the final reduced row-echelon form.  Suppose both of these columns are pivot columns (<a class="knowl" acro="RREF" type="Definition" title="Reduced Row-Echelon Form" knowl="./knowls/definition.RREF.knowl">Definition RREF</a>).  Then there is single row containing the two leading 1's of the two pivot columns, a violation of reduced row-echelon form (<a class="knowl" acro="RREF" type="Definition" title="Reduced Row-Echelon Form" knowl="./knowls/definition.RREF.knowl">Definition RREF</a>).  So at least one of these columns is not a pivot column, and the column index indicates a free variable in the description of the solution set (<a class="knowl" acro="IDV" type="Definition" title="Independent and Dependent Variables" knowl="./knowls/definition.IDV.knowl">Definition IDV</a>).  With a free variable, we arrive at an infinite solution set (<a class="knowl" acro="FVCS" type="Theorem" title="Free Variables for Consistent Systems" knowl="./knowls/theorem.FVCS.knowl">Theorem FVCS</a>).
