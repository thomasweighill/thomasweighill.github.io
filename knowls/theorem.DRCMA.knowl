<div class="statement"><p>Suppose that $A$ is a square matrix.  Let $B$ be the square matrix obtained from $A$ by multiplying a row by the scalar $\alpha$ and then adding it to another row, or by multiplying a column by the scalar $\alpha$ and then adding it to another column.  Then $\detname{B}=\detname{A}$.</p></div>
