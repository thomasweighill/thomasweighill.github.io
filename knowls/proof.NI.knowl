<p>(⇐)  Since $A$ is invertible, we can write $I_n=A\inverse{A}$ (<a class="knowl" acro="MI" type="Definition" title="Matrix Inverse" knowl="./knowls/definition.MI.knowl">Definition MI</a>).  Notice that $I_n$ is nonsingular (<a class="knowl" acro="NMRRI" type="Theorem" title="Nonsingular Matrices Row Reduce to the Identity matrix" knowl="./knowls/theorem.NMRRI.knowl">Theorem NMRRI</a>) so <a class="knowl" acro="NPNT" type="Theorem" title="Nonsingular Product has Nonsingular Terms" knowl="./knowls/theorem.NPNT.knowl">Theorem NPNT</a> implies that $A$ (and $\inverse{A}$) is nonsingular.</p>

<p>(⇒)  Suppose now that $A$ is nonsingular.  By <a class="knowl" acro="CINM" type="Theorem" title="Computing the Inverse of a Nonsingular Matrix" knowl="./knowls/theorem.CINM.knowl">Theorem CINM</a> we find $B$ so that $AB=I_n$.  Then <a class="knowl" acro="OSIS" type="Theorem" title="One-Sided Inverse is Sufficient" knowl="./knowls/theorem.OSIS.knowl">Theorem OSIS</a> tells us that $BA=I_n$.  So $B$ is $A$'s inverse, and by construction, $A$ is invertible.</p>
