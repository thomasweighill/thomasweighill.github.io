<div class="problem"><p>In the spirit of <a class="knowl" acro="SCAD" type="Example" title="Span of the columns of Archetype D" knowl="./knowls/example.SCAD.knowl">Example SCAD</a>, begin with the four columns of the coefficient matrix of <a knowl="./knowls/archetype.C.knowl">Archetype C</a>, and use these columns in a span construction to build the set $S$.  Argue that $S$ can be expressed as the span of just three of the columns of the coefficient matrix (saying exactly which three) and in the spirit of <a knowl="./knowls/exercise.SS.M20.knowl">Exercise SS.M20</a> argue that no one of these three vectors can be removed and still have a span construction create $S$.
