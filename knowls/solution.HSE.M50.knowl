</h5>Since the system is homogeneous, we know it has the trivial solution (<a class="knowl" acro="HSC" type="Theorem" title="Homogeneous Systems are Consistent" knowl="./knowls/theorem.HSC.knowl">Theorem HSC</a>).  We cannot say anymore based on the information provided, except to say that there is either a unique solution or infinitely many solutions (<a class="knowl" acro="PSSLS" type="Theorem" title="Possible Solution Sets for Linear Systems" knowl="./knowls/theorem.PSSLS.knowl">Theorem PSSLS</a>). See <a knowl="./knowls/archetype.A.knowl">Archetype A</a> and <a knowl="./knowls/archetype.B.knowl">Archetype B</a> to understand the possibilities.
