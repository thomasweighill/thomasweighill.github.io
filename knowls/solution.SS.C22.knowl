</h5>The vector form of the solutions obtained in this manner will involve precisely the vectors described in <a class="knowl" acro="SSNS" type="Theorem" title="Spanning Sets for Null Spaces" knowl="./knowls/theorem.SSNS.knowl">Theorem SSNS</a> as providing the null space of the coefficient matrix of the system as a span.  These vectors occur in each archetype in a description of the null space.  Studying <a class="knowl" acro="VFSAL" type="Example" title="Vector form of solutions for Archetype L" knowl="./knowls/example.VFSAL.knowl">Example VFSAL</a> may be of some help.
