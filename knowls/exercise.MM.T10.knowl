<div class="problem"><p>Suppose that $A$ is a square matrix and there is a vector, $\vect{b}$, such that $\linearsystem{A}{\vect{b}}$ has a unique solution.  Prove that $A$ is nonsingular.  Give a direct proof (perhaps appealing to <a class="knowl" acro="PSPHS" type="Theorem" title="Particular Solution Plus Homogeneous Solutions" knowl="./knowls/theorem.PSPHS.knowl">Theorem PSPHS</a>) rather than just negating a sentence from the text discussing a similar situation.
