<div class="statement"><p>Suppose that $S=\set{\vectorlist{v}{n}}\subseteq\complex{m}$ is a set of vectors and $A$ is the $m\times n$ matrix whose columns are the vectors in $S$.  Then $S$ is a linearly independent set if and only if the homogeneous system $\homosystem{A}$ has a unique solution.</p></div>
