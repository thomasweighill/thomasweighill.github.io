</h5>
<p>The null space of a square <em>matrix</em>, $A$, is equal to the set of solutions to the homogeneous <em>system</em>, $\homosystem{A}$.  A <em>matrix</em> is nonsingular if and only if the set of solutions to the homogeneous <em>system</em>, $\linearsystem{A}{\zerovector}$, has only a trivial solution.  These two observations may be chained together to construct the two proofs necessary for each half of this theorem.</p>
