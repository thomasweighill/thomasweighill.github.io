</h5>We assume $A$ is nonsingular, and try to solve the system $\linearsystem{A}{\vect{b}}$ without making any assumptions about $\vect{b}$.  To do this we will begin by constructing a new homogeneous linear system of equations that looks very much like the original.  Suppose $A$ has size $n$ (why must it be square?) and write the original system as,
\begin{align*}
a_{11}x_1+a_{12}x_2+a_{13}x_3+\dots+a_{1n}x_n&amp;=b_1\\
a_{21}x_1+a_{22}x_2+a_{23}x_3+\dots+a_{2n}x_n&amp;=b_2\\
a_{31}x_1+a_{32}x_2+a_{33}x_3+\dots+a_{3n}x_n&amp;=b_3\\
\vdots&amp;\tag{$*$}\\
a_{n1}x_1+a_{n2}x_2+a_{n3}x_3+\dots+a_{nn}x_n&amp;=b_n
\end{align*}

Form the new, homogeneous system in $n$ equations with $n+1$ variables, by adding a new variable $y$, whose coefficients are the negatives of the constant terms,
\begin{align*}
a_{11}x_1+a_{12}x_2+a_{13}x_3+\dots+a_{1n}x_n-b_1y&amp;=0\\
a_{21}x_1+a_{22}x_2+a_{23}x_3+\dots+a_{2n}x_n-b_2y&amp;=0\\
a_{31}x_1+a_{32}x_2+a_{33}x_3+\dots+a_{3n}x_n-b_3y&amp;=0\\
\vdots&amp;\tag{$**$}\\
a_{n1}x_1+a_{n2}x_2+a_{n3}x_3+\dots+a_{nn}x_n-b_ny&amp;=0
\end{align*}

Since this is a homogeneous system with more variables than equations ($m=n+1&gt;n$), <a class="knowl" acro="HMVEI" type="Theorem" title="Homogeneous, More Variables than Equations, Infinite solutions" knowl="./knowls/theorem.HMVEI.knowl">Theorem HMVEI</a> says that the system has infinitely many solutions.  We will choose one of these solutions, <em>any</em> one of these solutions, so long as it is <em>not</em> the trivial solution.  Write this solution as
\begin{align*}
x_1=c_1&amp;&amp;x_2=c_2&amp;&amp;x_3=c_3&amp;&amp;\ldots&amp;&amp;x_n=c_n&amp;&amp;y=c_{n+1}
\end{align*}

We know that at least one value of the $c_i$ is nonzero, but we will now show that in particular $c_{n+1}\neq 0$.  We do this using a proof by contradiction (<a class="knowl" acro="CD" type="Proof Technique" title="Contradiction" knowl="./knowls/technique.CD.knowl">Proof Technique CD</a>).  So suppose the $c_i$ form a solution as described, and in addition that $c_{n+1}=0$.  Then we can write the $i$-th equation of system $(**)$ as,
\begin{align*}
a_{i1}c_1+a_{i2}c_2+a_{i3}c_3+\dots+a_{in}c_n-b_i(0)&amp;=0\\
\end{align*}
which becomes
\begin{align*}

a_{i1}c_1+a_{i2}c_2+a_{i3}c_3+\dots+a_{in}c_n&amp;=0\\
\end{align*}

Since this is true for each $i$, we have that $x_1=c_1,\,x_2=c_2,\,x_3=c_3,\ldots,\,x_n=c_n$ is a solution to the homogeneous system $\homosystem{A}$ formed with a nonsingular coefficient matrix.  This means that the only possible solution is the trivial solution, so $c_1=0,\,c_2=0,\,c_3=0,\,\ldots,\,c_n=0$.  So, assuming simply that $c_{n+1}=0$, we conclude that <em>all</em> of the $c_i$ are zero.  But this contradicts our choice of the $c_i$ as not being the trivial solution to the system $(**)$.  So $c_{n+1}\neq 0$.<br><br>
We now propose and verify a solution to the original system $(*)$.  Set
\begin{align*}
x_1=\frac{c_1}{c_{n+1}}&amp;&amp;x_2=\frac{c_2}{c_{n+1}}&amp;&amp;x_3=\frac{c_3}{c_{n+1}}&amp;&amp;\ldots&amp;&amp;x_n=\frac{c_n}{c_{n+1}}
\end{align*}

Notice how it was necessary that we know that $c_{n+1}\neq 0$ for this step to succeed.  Now, evaluate the $i$-th equation of system $(*)$ with this proposed solution, and recognize in the third line that $c_1$ through $c_{n+1}$  appear as if they were substituted into the left-hand side of the $i$-th equation of system $(**)$,
\begin{align*}
&amp;a_{i1}\frac{c_1}{c_{n+1}}+a_{i2}\frac{c_2}{c_{n+1}}+a_{i3}\frac{c_3}{c_{n+1}}+\dots+a_{in}\frac{c_n}{c_{n+1}}\\
&amp;=\frac{1}{c_{n+1}}\left(a_{i1}c_1+a_{i2}c_2+a_{i3}c_3+\dots+a_{in}c_n\right)\\
&amp;=\frac{1}{c_{n+1}}\left(a_{i1}c_1+a_{i2}c_2+a_{i3}c_3+\dots+a_{in}c_n-b_ic_{n+1}\right)+b_i\\
&amp;=\frac{1}{c_{n+1}}\left(0\right)+b_i\\
&amp;=b_i
\end{align*}

Since this equation is true for every $i$, we have found a solution to system $(*)$.  To finish, we still need to establish that this solution is <em>unique</em>.<br><br>
With one solution in hand, we will entertain the possibility of a second solution.  So assume system $(*)$ has two solutions,
\begin{align*}
x_1=d_1&amp;&amp;x_2=d_2&amp;&amp;x_3=d_3&amp;&amp;\ldots&amp;&amp;x_n=d_n\\
x_1=e_1&amp;&amp;x_2=e_2&amp;&amp;x_3=e_3&amp;&amp;\ldots&amp;&amp;x_n=e_n
\end{align*}

Then,
\begin{align*}
&amp;\left(a_{i1}(d_1-e_1)+a_{i2}(d_2-e_2)+a_{i3}(d_3-e_3)+\dots+a_{in}(d_n-e_n)\right)\\
&amp;=\left(a_{i1}d_1+a_{i2}d_2+a_{i3}d_3+\dots+a_{in}d_n\right)-\left(a_{i1}e_1+a_{i2}e_2+a_{i3}e_3+\dots+a_{in}e_n\right)\\
&amp;=b_i-b_i\\
&amp;=0
\end{align*}

This is the $i$-th equation of the homogeneous system $\homosystem{A}$ evaluated with $x_j=d_j-e_j$, $1\leq j\leq n$.  Since $A$ is nonsingular, we must conclude that this solution is the trivial solution, and so $0=d_j-e_j$, $1\leq j\leq n$.  That is, $d_j=e_j$ for all $j$ and the two solutions are identical, meaning any solution to $(*)$ is unique.<br><br>\medskip
Notice that the proposed solution ($x_i=\frac{c_i}{c_{n+1}}$) appeared in this proof with no motivation whatsoever.  This is just fine in a proof.  A proof should <em>convince</em> you that a theorem is <em>true</em>.  It is your job to <em>read</em> the proof and be convinced of every assertion.  Questions like “Where did that come from?” or “How would I think of that?” have no bearing on the <em>validity</em> of the proof.
