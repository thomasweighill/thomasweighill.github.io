<div class="problem"><p>Suppose that we are checking if a square matrix of size $n$ is unitary.  Show that a straightforward application of <a class="knowl" acro="CUMOS" type="Theorem" title="Columns of Unitary Matrices are Orthonormal Sets" knowl="./knowls/theorem.CUMOS.knowl">Theorem CUMOS</a> requires the computation of $n^2$ inner products when the matrix is unitary, and fewer when the matrix is not orthogonal.  Then show that this maximum number of inner products can be reduced to $\frac{1}{2}n(n+1)$ in light of <a class="knowl" acro="IPAC" type="Theorem" title="Inner Product is Anti-Commutative" knowl="./knowls/theorem.IPAC.knowl">Theorem IPAC</a>.
