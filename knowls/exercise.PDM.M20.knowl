<div class="problem"><p>Construct a $3\times 3$ nonsingular matrix and call it $A$.  Then, for each entry of the matrix, compute the corresponding cofactor, and create a new $3\times 3$ matrix full of these cofactors by placing the cofactor of an entry in the same location as the entry it was based on.  Once complete, call this matrix $C$.  Compute $A\transpose{C}$.  Any observations?  Repeat with a new matrix, or perhaps with a $4\times 4$ matrix.
