<p>If we use a linearly dependent set to construct a span, then we can <em>always</em> create the same infinite set with a starting set that is one vector smaller in size.  We will illustrate this behavior in <a class="knowl" acro="RSC5" type="Example" title="Reducing a span in $\complex{5}$" knowl="./knowls/example.RSC5.knowl">Example RSC5</a>.  However, this will not be possible if we build a span from a linearly independent set.  So in a certain sense, using a linearly independent set to formulate a span is the best possible way â€” there are not any extra vectors being used to build up all the necessary linear combinations.  OK, here is the theorem, and then the example.</p>

<div class="statement"><p>Suppose that $S=\set{\vectorlist{u}{n}}$ is a set of vectors.  Then $S$ is a linearly dependent set if and only if there is an index $t$, $1\leq t\leq n$ such that $\vect{u_t}$ is a linear combination of the vectors $\vect{u}_1,\,\vect{u}_2,\,\vect{u}_3,\,\ldots,\,\vect{u}_{t-1},\,\vect{u}_{t+1},\,\ldots,\,\vect{u}_n$.</p></div>

<p>This theorem can be used, sometimes repeatedly, to whittle down the size of a set of vectors used in a span construction.  We have seen some of this already in <a class="knowl" acro="SCAD" type="Example" title="Span of the columns of Archetype D" knowl="./knowls/example.SCAD.knowl">Example SCAD</a>, but in the next example we will detail some of the subtleties.</p>
