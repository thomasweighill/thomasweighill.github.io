<div class="problem"><p>Suppose that the set $S$ in the hypothesis of <a class="knowl" acro="GSP" type="Theorem" title="Gram-Schmidt Procedure" knowl="./knowls/theorem.GSP.knowl">Theorem GSP</a> is not just linearly independent, but is also orthogonal.  Prove that the set $T$ created by the Gram-Schmidt procedure is equal to $S$.  (Note that we are getting a stronger conclusion than $\spn{T}=\spn{S}$ â€” the conclusion is that $T=S$.)  In other words, it is pointless to apply the Gram-Schmidt procedure to a set that is already orthogonal.
