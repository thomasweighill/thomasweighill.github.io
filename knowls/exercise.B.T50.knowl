<div class="problem"><p><a class="knowl" acro="UMCOB" type="Theorem" title="Unitary Matrices Convert Orthonormal Bases" knowl="./knowls/theorem.UMCOB.knowl">Theorem UMCOB</a> says that unitary matrices are characterized as those matrices that “carry” orthonormal bases to orthonormal bases.  This problem asks you to prove a similar result:  nonsingular matrices are characterized as those matrices that “carry” bases to bases.<br><br>
More precisely, suppose that $A$ is a square matrix of size $n$ and $B=\set{\vectorlist{x}{n}}$ is a basis of $\complex{n}$.  Prove that $A$ is nonsingular if and only if $C=\set{A\vect{x}_1,\,A\vect{x}_2,\,A\vect{x}_3,\,\dots,\,A\vect{x}_n}$ is a basis of $\complex{n}$.
