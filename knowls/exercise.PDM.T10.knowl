<div class="problem"><p><a class="knowl" acro="NPNT" type="Theorem" title="Nonsingular Product has Nonsingular Terms" knowl="./knowls/theorem.NPNT.knowl">Theorem NPNT</a> says that if the product of square matrices $AB$ is nonsingular, then the individual matrices $A$ and $B$ are nonsingular also.  Construct a new proof of this result making use of theorems about determinants of matrices.
