<p>If $A$ is the coefficient matrix of a system of linear equations and $\vect{b}$ is the vector of constants, then we will write $\linearsystem{A}{\vect{b}}$ as a shorthand expression for the  system of linear equations, which we will refer to as the <em class="term">matrix representation</em> of the linear system.</p>
