<div class="statement"><p>Suppose $A$ is the augmented matrix of a <em>consistent</em> system of linear equations with $n$ variables.  Suppose also that $B$ is a row-equivalent matrix in reduced row-echelon form with $r$ rows that are not completely zeros.  Then the solution set can be described with $n-r$ free variables.</p></div>
