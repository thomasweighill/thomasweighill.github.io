<p>We have seen, both in theorems and in examples, that questions about linear transformations are often equivalent to questions about matrices.  It is the matrix representation of a linear transformation that makes this idea precise.  Here is our final theorem that solidifies this connection.</p>

</h5>
<div class="statement"><p>Suppose that $\ltdefn{T}{U}{V}$ is a linear transformation, $B$ is a basis for $U$ and $C$ is a basis for $V$. Then $T$ is an invertible linear transformation if and only if the matrix representation of $T$ relative to $B$ and $C$, $\matrixrep{T}{B}{C}$ is an invertible matrix.  When $T$ is invertible,
\begin{equation*}
\matrixrep{\ltinverse{T}}{C}{B}=\inverse{\left(\matrixrep{T}{B}{C}\right)}
\end{equation*}

<p>By now, the connections between matrices and linear transformations should be starting to become more transparent, and you may have already recognized the invertibility of a matrix as being  tantamount to the invertibility of the associated matrix representation.  The next example shows how to apply this theorem to the problem of actually building a formula for the inverse of an invertible linear transformation.</p>

<p>This theorem may seem gratuitous.  Why state such a special case of <a class="knowl" acro="IMR" type="Theorem" title="Invertible Matrix Representations" knowl="./knowls/theorem.IMR.knowl">Theorem IMR</a>?  Because it adds another condition to our NMEx series of theorems, and in some ways it is the most fundamental expression of what it means for a matrix to be nonsingular â€” the associated linear transformation is invertible.  This is our final update.</p>
