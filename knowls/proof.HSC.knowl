<p>Set each variable of the system to zero.  When substituting these values into each equation, the left-hand side evaluates to zero, no matter what the coefficients are.  Since a homogeneous system has zero on the right-hand side of each equation as the constant term, each equation is true.  With one demonstrated solution, we can call the system consistent.</p>
