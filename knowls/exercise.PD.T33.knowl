<div class="problem"><p>Part of <a knowl="./knowls/exercise.B.T50.knowl">Exercise B.T50</a> is the half of the proof where we assume the matrix $A$ is nonsingular and prove that a set is a basis.  In <a knowl="./knowls/solution.B.T50.knowl">Solution B.T50</a> we proved directly that the set was both linearly independent and a spanning set.  Shorten this part of the proof by applying <a class="knowl" acro="G" type="Theorem" title="Goldilocks" knowl="./knowls/theorem.G.knowl">Theorem G</a>.  Be careful, there is one subtlety.
