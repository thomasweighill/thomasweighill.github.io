<p>The equivalence of the first and last statements is <a class="knowl" acro="SMZE" type="Theorem" title="Singular Matrices have Zero Eigenvalues" knowl="./knowls/theorem.SMZE.knowl">Theorem SMZE</a>, reformulated by negating each statement in the equivalence.  So we are able to improve on <a class="knowl" acro="NME7" type="Theorem" title="Nonsingular Matrix Equivalences, Round 7" knowl="./knowls/theorem.NME7.knowl">Theorem NME7</a> with this addition.</p>
