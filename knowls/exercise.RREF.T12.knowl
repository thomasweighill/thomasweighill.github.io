<div class="problem"><p>Suppose that $B$ is an $m\times n$ matrix in reduced row-echelon form.  Build a new, likely smaller, $k\times\ell$ matrix $C$ as follows.  Keep any collection of $k$ adjacent rows, $k\leq m$.  From these rows, keep columns $1$ through $\ell$, $\ell\leq n$.  Prove that $C$ is in reduced row-echelon form.
