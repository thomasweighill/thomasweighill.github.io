<div class="statement"><p>Suppose that $S=\set{\vectorlist{u}{n}}$ is a set of vectors.  Then $S$ is a linearly dependent set if and only if there is an index $t$, $1\leq t\leq n$ such that $\vect{u_t}$ is a linear combination of the vectors $\vect{u}_1,\,\vect{u}_2,\,\vect{u}_3,\,\ldots,\,\vect{u}_{t-1},\,\vect{u}_{t+1},\,\ldots,\,\vect{u}_n$.</p></div>
