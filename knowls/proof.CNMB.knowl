<p>(⇒)  Suppose that the columns of $A$ are a basis for $\complex{m}$.

<p>(⇐)  Suppose that $A$ is nonsingular.  Then by <a class="knowl" acro="NMLIC" type="Theorem" title="Nonsingular Matrices have Linearly Independent Columns" knowl="./knowls/theorem.NMLIC.knowl">Theorem NMLIC</a> this set of columns is linearly independent.  <a class="knowl" acro="CSNM" type="Theorem" title="Column Space of a Nonsingular Matrix" knowl="./knowls/theorem.CSNM.knowl">Theorem CSNM</a> says that for a nonsingular matrix, $\csp{A}=\complex{m}$.  This is equivalent to saying that the columns of $A$ are a spanning set for the vector space $\complex{m}$.  As a linearly independent spanning set, the columns of $A$ qualify as a basis for $\complex{m}$ (<a class="knowl" acro="B" type="Definition" title="Basis" knowl="./knowls/definition.B.knowl">Definition B</a>).</p>
