<div class="problem"><p>Suppose that $V$ is a vector space and $\alpha\in\complexes$ is a scalar such that $\alpha\vect{x}=\vect{x}$ for every $\vect{x}\in V$.  Prove that $\alpha = 1$.  In other words, <a class="knowl" acro="O" type="Property" title="One" knowl="./knowls/property.O.knowl">Property O</a> is not duplicated for any other scalar but the “special” scalar, 1.  (This question was suggested by James Gallagher.)
