</h5>In each case, begin with a vector equation where one side contains a linear combination of the two vectors from the span construction that gives the column space of $A$ with unknowns for scalars, and then use <a class="knowl" acro="SLSLC" type="Theorem" title="Solutions to Linear Systems are Linear Combinations" knowl="./knowls/theorem.SLSLC.knowl">Theorem SLSLC</a> to set up a system of equations.  For $\vect{c}$, the resulting system has no solution, as we would expect.<br><br>
For $\vect{b}$ there is a solution, as we would expect.  What is interesting is that the solution is unique.  This is a consequence of the linear independence of the set of two vectors in the span construction.  If we wrote $\vect{b}$ as a linear combination of all four columns of $A$, then there would be infinitely many ways to do this.
