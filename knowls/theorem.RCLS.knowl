<div class="statement"><p>Suppose $A$ is the augmented matrix of a system of linear equations with $n$ variables.  Suppose also that $B$ is a row-equivalent matrix in reduced row-echelon form with $r$ nonzero rows.  Then the system of equations is inconsistent if and only if column $n+1$ of $B$ is a pivot column.</p></div>
